Later he obtained and recorded two others, one October 23, 1854, from Ila pintabi, and the other December 31, 1856, from lyapali. Ilapintabi told him that the year began in the latter part of Sep tember, while, according to lyapali, it was in the latter part of March. Both of these statements are reconciled by a subsequent note to the effect that the year w r as divided into two series of six months each, a summer series and a win ter series. From the time when these are said to have begun, September 21 and March 21, it is evident that the autumnal and vernal equinoxes were taken as start ing points. The list of months obtained from lyapali is in almost complete agree ment w r ith the earliest list recorded by Byington, and therefore is probably more correct than that of Ilapintabi. It is as follows: \nMarch- April, chafo chito (from \nhohchqfo chito, \"big famine\") \nApril-May, hash koi n chush. \nMay-June, liash koichito. \nJune-July, hash mall. \nJuly-August, hash watullak. \nAugust-September, tek i n 1iqshi. \nSeptember-October, Jnisli bUii. \nOctober-November, hash bissa. \nNovember-December, hash leaf. \nDecember-January, hash takkon. \nJanuary-February, hash Jiopoui. \nFebruary-March, diajiskono (from hoJicJiqfo iskiti- ni, \"little fam ine\"). \nBesides some inconsequential differ ences the earliest list has hasJt tratonlttk instead of fiqsli, watullak. No May-June month occurs in this list unless it is rep resented by \"fuak uiosJioli,\" the specific- application of which is not given, and \nBYI.NGTOX] \nA DICTIONARY OF THE CHOCTAW LANGUAGE \n147 \nwhich appears to have been questioned by Mr. Byington s later informants. Since, however, a year of twelve strictly lunar months must be corrected at inter vals to agree with the solar year, the editor suggests that luak mosholi, which means \"fire extinguished,\" may have applied to an intercalary month or period at the time of the annual festival when the year began anew. Ilapintabi s list differs from that given only in inverting hash kofochush and hash koicltito, and hash mail and hash watullak, the first being made to fall in May-June, the second in April-May, the third in July-August, and the fourth in June-July.
