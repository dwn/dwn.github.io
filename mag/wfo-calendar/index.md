# Wfo Calendar

Dan Nielsen 3/2021

## Intro

Over the years, I've experimented with calendar systems for our solar system, finally settling into this scheme, which basically seems to be the most natural possible. It's simpler and more ordinary than some of the other methods I'd tried, but the pieces fit together very neatly.

## 28-day mensis

The lunation is 29.530587981 days as seen from Earth (synodic). As seen against the stars, the month would be about 27 1/3 days long (sidereal), but we will not make use of the sidereal value.

Instead we will make use of a 28-day month. Although its length is between the sidereal and synodic timespans, it wouldn't seem to have much else going for it. It is the average duration of a human woman's menstrual cycle, although such cycles can vary. In fact *mensis* originally meant month. For this reason, let one *mensis* equal 28 days. For humans, the average length of *gestation* = 10 *menses*.

There are more surprising facts about the 28-day month, however, that make it a great unit of time upon which to fashion a calendar.

### Basic cycles and corrections

Three solar years is approximately 37 lunations, or 39 menses.

Initial error of menses against one year
( 38 * 28 - 3 * 365.2422 ) / 3 = -1.2422 days

Initial error of lunations against one year
( 37 * 29.530587981 - 3 * 365.2422 ) / 3 = -1.031614901 days

So every year, we add one day to each. Then...

Error of menses against one year: -.2422 days

Error of lunations against one year: -.031614901 days

In order to match the two types of month counts, we should add one day to the mensis count every ~4.75 years.

1 / ( lunations error - menses error ) = 4.74867407404 years

After 19 years, about four days will have been added to the mensis count, since 19 / 4.74867407404 = 4.001116881.

19 years is also Meton's cycle, or nearly exactly 235 lunations.
