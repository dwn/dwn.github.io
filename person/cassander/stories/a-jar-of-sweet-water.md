# A Jar of Sweetwater

#### Cassander Garduna

## Island mentality

On Athlandrun, the island of the driftwood people, life is taken in stride and Seriousness is reserved only for dire situations, this is the island mentality. King Migka narudt, Prince Snalla,  and little Tegla sat on the beach this night playing Gvli’s game as they watched the moon bring the tide in. Tegla had cards hidden in the inner pocket of her white and apricot colored cloak, Snalla had secretly shuffled the deck to his favor, and Migka who was keeping score had miss-tallied his points higher than the other two. Amongst the driftwood tribe a good cheater was considered very clever and applauded for their skill. the trick of course was not to get caught which in many games would mean a reduction of points, but cheating itself was both expected and encouraged. Many fish tales have been told around the campfire by the most clever of the tribe about how they outwitted their opponent with slight of hand, or how they manipulated a game of chance, and most important, how they did it all with a straight face. Tegla, young and inexperience relative to her older competitors fumbled trying to secret a card from her cloak. Both Migka and Snalla noticed, but said nothing, they instead gave each other a knowing look and a simple smile. Migka also new about Snalla stacking the deck, but as the only of the three able to do simple arithmetic and tonight’s scorekeeper the sly old king had won before the game ever began. When the game was over and Migka had won Snalla taught Tegla and important lesson about distraction and eye contact.

“If their looking at your eyes, they’re not looking at your hands”, instructed Snalla, “also wait for a distraction before you act or better yet create one!”

One second the warm night air blew across their bodies the next a cold breeze crept across the beach, and screaming could be heard across the island. Even those now in the subterranean tunnels which scouts and hunters used to travers the island, and where many of the driftwood tribe lived included Migka and Snalla the screams could be heard. Even far north in the old cold the Spirits of the cold trembled and stirred as the scream echoed through the barren wastes. The three stud up, startled by the cry.

“That is Nagku again”, said Migka. Soon the storms will come.

“This is the third night in a row”, replied Snalla

“I fear the atzutza (the forgetting plant) is loosing its effect, and the singers and drummers meant to calm him have begun only to annoy.” 

“What plagues him father?”

“I couldn’t say, the ascetic fights himself. A struggle between mind and spirit. When you were just learning to walk he first appeared and lectured us night and day on a philosophy he called the re-wilding. He told us that enlightenment would be found in the unlearning and unknowing. That knowledge itself was poison, and that language was a curse that bound us in chains made of illusions. Some saw him as a mad man, others a teacher and a wiseman who taught a lesson meant to be forgot, and others still as a paggwari (medicine man) meant to heal our hearts and past wounds with his teachings.”

“You said “when he first appeared” do you mean to say he doesn’t come from the island?”

“He wouldn’t talk about his past or where he came from, but said only that the island itself brought him here, that it chose him to be its guardian, it’s avatar. I only know that several times we have seen large Annathari (stranger) ships unlike our own not far from shore. In a frenzy I would rally the warriors preparing for an invasion, but then all of a sudden a impenetrable fog would surround the island, I believe this Nagku’s work. I think he may be our greatest weapon, but at the same time if we can’t calm the beast he may be our undoing.

## A jar of sweet water

The next morning Migka gathered his council in a room beneath the earth. 

“The storms are getting worse, something must be done” said Migka to the old faces before him.

“How can we calm him, when we don’t know what troubles him” spoke one of the council

“Can he even still speak?” Asked another 

“Soon we will all be underwater, did you see the size of the waves this morning King Migka!, and the deer doubled back on our hunters last night chasing them back into the tunnels! Is this Nagku’s doing!” Tsugla hollered always the doomsayer

“Calm down” said Migka in his biggest voice. We mustn’t loose are heads. I have decided to send someone into the dark forest today, to seek Nagku out, and see if he can still speak, or if there may be some other way to ascertain what exactly is happening to this poor creature. 

“Who will you send?” Asked Prince Snalla from the back of the room. 

Migka hesitated, then a small voice spoke up. 

“I will do it”, said Telga. Far be it from me to boost, but I am known across the island as the dirftwood tribes finest scout. I can run swiftly and silently, I can hide in the shadows, and I believe myself capable of evading the beast if necessary. 

“Are you sure, Telga? You don’t have to do this.” Said Migka in a fatherly voice.

“I feel that I must, not just for you, or my people, or this island we call home, but for myself. I want it to be known that Tegla De Nammi Nishgwi (a jar of sweet water) is the very bravest amongst the driftwood people, live or die, this will be my legacy.” 

“So be it, prepare yourself and head out at once, report back as soon as you know something.”

The chamber began to empty. Snalla came up behind tegla in the tunnel and laid his hand on her shoulder.

Snalla then told her, “Telga you will need a migwid (mask) to filter out the smoke of the atzutza plant or you may loose your wits, and here take this whistle, blow it if something goes wrong and you need help.” 

Snalla was renowned as a whistle maker, each was enchanted, and engraved with a magical writing known as the little moon fish alphabet given to them by a clever fish in a stream. No one but Snalla himself, not even his father King Migka knew how the enchantments worked. This was a great honor for Tegla. She took the whistle in her hand, looked up into Snalla’s dark brown eyes, and softly whispered “thank you.”

Tegla went back to her hut to grab supplies, she had a white and apricot colored mask in the guise of a cats face with whiskers and all which matched the cloak she wore. She put wet sea sponge in the muzzle of her mask hoping it would filter out the smoke of the atzutza which Nagku constantly burned. She tucked a small dagger in her belt, and then put on her white rabbit fur moccasins. The whistle which Snalla gave her had a hoop at one end, she put a string through this hoop making a necklace out of the whistle and put that over her head and around her neck. She also smuged her face with white pine ash which was the custom for scouts. She was ready. Instead of going directly in to the dark forest Tegla decided to make her way towards the center of the forest underground through one of tunnels commonly used by hunters. The way was lite by lumifarious fungi that clung to the walls of the passage which was tended to by particularly skilled tribesmen that did nothing else but keep the walls glowing with that blue light.

## A meeting with the unlearning beast

Now in the heart of the dark forest without fear but rather excitement Tegla’s steps are swift and quiet like secret messages. There is a miasmic fog of atzutza smoke which makes it hard to see and the mask only doubles this difficulty obscuring her peripheral sight. Her breath is hot and wet inside the mask. The sea sponge helped she thought, but as she felt herself growing ever more lighter and lighter she realized some of the smoke must have been seeping through. The creeping vines which rapped around the ancient pines seemed to twist and move like nervous snakes. Geometric patterns appeared in the bark of the pao-pao trees and the leaves of the nightjar bushes. The yellow of the hyelala flower seemed to shimmer, glow, and dance about as if to wantonly distract her from her quest, while other things remained as still as sleep. Thoughts and images which felt significant for a second burst into her minds eye and then disappeared and were forgotten as quickly as they had arrived. She shook her head as if to shake off the influence of the smoke, but it was too late, all was a dream now and she was an unwilling participant in its story. The insects sang the night in and the moons light trickled down the vast green of the dark forest, all waltzing shadows and ghosts that seemed to jump in and out of existence, wanting to both be seen and stay unseen. Tegla now forgetting what she had came there for took off her mask and sat quietly on a jutting root of a ancient tree. Time stoped under the tree, There was only now, and although this nowness was a fundamental belief of the tribe it was somehow different here. To the tribe the past was considered dead, and those that stayed there in their minds ghosts, and the future just simmering illusions meant to be ignored. Time to the tribe didn’t flow like a river, but instead sat still like a pool. You did not progress through time, but stayed always and forever in the endless present. Of course even believing this philosophy the tribe could clearly see the effect of one thing on another, the start and end of a day, the rising and siting of the sun and the moon. Telga thought about this absence of time and it occurred to her that it was possible that time hadn’t stoped but instead this was an illusion created by the fact that she couldn’t remember the moment before, and of course this progression of time anyway was a false assumption of the mind made by memory and change. This must be it she thought. 

“Climb, grandchild!” A small voice said in her ear.

“Who’s there?” Startled by the voice Tegla demanded an answer.

“It’s me granddaughter, Hen Silma Fluga (the old firefly).” “The smoke is heavy and stays near the ground, you need to travel through the trees, my dear.”

Telga then in her periphery saw the yellow-green light of the fireflies tail, looked over, and saw her savior sitting on her shoulder, a firefly, orange and black. 

“I don’t know if I can, I feel so strange!” 

“Then I will carry you, child.”

The old firefly grabbed the hood of her cloak, tugged, and suddenly Tegla was air born, rushing higher and higher into the canopy. The old firefly sat her down on a large tree limb, and the dream abated, though slowly, and reason returned to Tegla.

“Thank you” she announced bitterly, with a great amount of reservation.

“No need to thank me, grandchild, but I must be on my way though, I’ve dinner cooking!”

Tegla’s pride was hurt. This is not the story she imagined, being saved instead of doing the saving. Maybe this part of the story I will omit she thought. 

Some time past, and the quest Telga was set on came back to her mind.

“Nagku, I must find Nagku.” She said aloud to herself.

The branches of these mammoth trees were so big in this the dimma skog (dark forest) she mearly had to hop from one arm to another. She now saw a flickering light in the distance, a campfire where the smoke was coming from, and she new then she was headed in the right direction, though still unsure what she might say to Nagku when she got there, maybe I need say nothing, she thought. She covered the distance quickly and then rested herself on a tree limb above Nagku. Tegla now watched the beast as it circled the fire in a well rooted out track dug into the dirt. He had looked like a man once, but his form had shifted over the years as he himself had gone through this process of re-wilding. Once a regular sort, a man of average height with dark curly hair and an olive completion, Tegla now saw a beast with a large round moon like face, black claws which grew from black hands, grey ghostly skin, teeth like that of a tiger but twisting and jutting from the beasts maw, large wild golden eyes that the campfire light bounced off of, and shaggy brown fur covering his gaunt torso” Tegla watched as Nagku stopped circling the campfire and crouched down beside it like some great ape. he began to cry and Tegla felt a cold harsh breeze move in, it made the flames of the fire dance this way and that. A gust almost toppled Tegla from her seat, but she grabbed onto a close branch just before she fell. She almost sighed in relief, but wouldn’t so easily make a sound and give the game away. Nagku then started digging up the dirt and grass in a spot close to the fire. He layed down in this spot and after some time went to sleep. Tegla noticed the unused hut of obvious kitka (driftwood people) design just feet away. Nagku began to toss and turn in his sleep and the ground shook, he screamed out and thunder stuck. The wind became violent and the trees swayed in its grip, old dead branches detracted and flew through the air. Eltfa (the volcano at the center of the island) began to rumble and stir, black smoke sprung from its gapping mouth clowding the night sky and bloting out the silver face of the moon. Nagku screamed out again in his misery and the cold wind blew down the tree Tegla sat in, she jumped at just the right moment and was unharmed, but now on the ground felt vulnerable in the open dispatched from her comfortable observatory in the trees. Nagku called out again and red hot blood from the earth burst from the mountain and trickled down face. Several other trees feel around Tegla before she ran to Nagku. 

“Wake up! Wake up!” Tegla hollered as she shook the twisted form now in her hands.

Nagku’s eyes opened, and Tegla instantly discerned her mistake. The flames flickered in the large golden eyes that pressed upon her as if to undo her completely. The eyes stared at her and through, not without some surprise and confusion, but still with utter disdain. Nagku’s hand struck out like the darting movement of a snake bite and Tegla was lifted from the ground now in the claws of the beast, faster than age, faster than the fleeting nature of young love, and strong enough to lift any mountain. Never had Tegla witnessed such a force of nature, this being holding her was the volcano, was the wind, was the island itself. The animals of the island howled, squawked, moaned, growled from every direction. Nagku’s mood enveloped the island, dictated the weather, and even moved the temperament of the animals. Then a thought sprang froward in Tegla’s mind, the whistle! She grabbed at her chest searching and found it in her hand. She put in to her mouth and blew, and it sounded like a banshees call. Suddenly she left Nagku’s grasp and started sinking into the earth. She waved her arms in a frenzy trying to grab on to any little thing, but her hands went through everything, she had become intangible. She quickly figured out that her movement now was not according to her body or musculature, but instead her mind, her thoughts. She thought up and up she went, at speeds unknown to her in her physical form. In fractions of a second she was above the tops of the trees. She watched the beast look around dismayed. She knew now that Nagku’s nightmares were cause of the turmoil and she remembered Migka saying to report back to him, but she thought how bigger the hero would I be if I handled this myself!

## The masks that the monsters wear

Telga but thought the word beach and found her self here above the white sands. She hovered close to the ground and blew the whistle again and was once more solid. She sat and contemplated the situation as she watched the waves approach and retreat. “If I could only enter Nagku’s dreams I could kill whatever nightmare monster is haunting him” she thought. I need the paggwari’s (healer/frog man) dream song. She had seen a paggwari named Bruga Suti relieve warriors of there night-terrors by entering their dreams and giving them council there when she was younger. Bruga like all paggwari lived in the swamps. The sun began to rise, the night creatures went to sleep, and the day creatures arose to greet the morning. She put the whistle to her lips once again and blew. Bruga’s hut she thought, and without any time passing there she was in the wet of the swamp in front of his humble abode. Bruga was just waking up, and heading out to start cooking breakfast. Not yet knowing she was there he met Tegla outside the leather door of his living quarters. The frogman was covered head to toe in algae and swamp muck. He was short in stature, and wore little clothing. His eyes were big and black and his face a pale green.

“Tegla, is that you?” He said wiping the sleep from his eyes, “what brings you here?”

“I am here on urgent business” she said with authority, “I need to learn the dream song”

“The dream song? What for?” 

“Please, I haven’t time for questions, can you teach it to me?”

“Sure I can, young scout, but first let me make some yaba (a drink not unlike coffee) we will need focus and energy”

The song was in a language foreign to Telga. Hours past as they went over the words, pronunciation, and melody, until finally Bruga was satisfied with her singing. 

“Stay here” said Bruga as he went back inside his tiny hut. 

In the hut he scribbled down the lyrics onto a piece of parchment that was light brown in color and looked like the membrane of a bats wing. He wrote this song in the little moon fish alphabet. Both the language of the Kitka Nishgwi Lanta and the little moon fish alphabet were considered alive, made from magic, and thought to shape reality when spoken or written. it was commonly known that the Pale Blue Traveler (the creator of all things) spoke the world into existence. Language was thought to be extremely powerful, to mold perception and the world around us, not just by the words you spoke, but also those words that ran through your mind, and so a wiseman thought about his words before he spoke, controlled his thoughts, and tried not to bring negativity into the world. To think positive thoughts was the way of the wise. Positive words and thoughts brought good things into the world. 

“Don’t sing the words too quickly or to slowly, remember the pace we practiced. You must close you eyes and envision the person sleeping while singing the song, if done right this will allow you to enter their dream, and here take this paper, I’ve written the words down for you in case you forget.”

Thank you, Bruga, and for now can we keep this between each other?”

Bruga thought about this for a moment and was intrigued by the mystery and secrecy he had suddenly become apart of. 

“Sure, Tegla, but once your adventure is over you must come back and tell me the story, this is the deal.”

Tegla agreed then once more blew the whistle Snalla had given her. “Up” she thought and she rose into the air. She watched Bruga’s expression and laughed as he, wide eyed and full of wonder, looked around for the now invisible Tegla. She then thought Nagku and was instantaneously back in the smoky depths of the dark forest. Still in the air she watched Nagku once again circle his fire, stopping every once in a while to add more atzutza to the flames. It was twilight now, and soon Tegla saw the Eye of the night rise into the nighttime sky. The beast seemed to move slower this night than the last, and his face was sad and almost child-like now. She pitied him, and held no grudge against him for the previous night. Any cornered beast will eventually attack she thought, it’s not really his fault, and once this is over I’ll not only be the greatest scout, but a hero to my people, and you my friend can get some sleep. They’ll write songs about me, my story will be recorded in the scrolls or record, and I’ll never be forgotten! Excitement and joy swelled up in Tegla’s heart at the thought. Nagku seemed to be a creature of habit at least as far as Tegla could tell by watching him these two nights. Just as the night before Nagku tossed the dirt and grass in the shallow hole in which he slept then layed down. It wasn’t long before Nagku seemed to be asleep, but Tegla waited a while longer just in case. She thought “down” and descended back to the ground beside the wild ascetic. The cold wind started to pick up. Nagku thrashed about and moaned and the ground shook. This made Tegla nervous for a second having the previous night still fresh in her mind, but she easily swallowed down that temporary nervousness, and became calm again. She took the piece of parchment Bu had given her from the inside pocket of her cloak and began, in a whisper, to sing the dream song. She closed her eyes and imaged Nagku’s face. She got to the end of the song and for a moment before she opened her eyes she thought maybe she had sang it wrong, that nothing had happened, but then she realized she no longer heard the wind. She opened her eyes not knowing what to expect, and found herself at sea with turbulent waves pushing her in every direction. The sea was the color of honey, the sky blood red, and the sun a brilliant shade of shining indigo. not able to see a shoreline she thought for a second about drowning and questioned the rules of the dreamworld. “If I die here will I die in real life, of simply be banished from the dream?” She decided to swim for a while and search for shore, but there was no shore to be found. Her dream body didn’t tier but she felt more and more that seeking out a shoreline was going to be a fruitless endeavor. It was at that moment, floating there in the endless sea of honey that she heard Nagku’s scream coming from below her. She looked down into the depths and instead of seeing the pitch black of the ocean, she saw light. She took a few deep breaths and dove down into the sea. One moment she was swimming down ever more closer to the light and a moment later she was falling. She landed on her stomach with a sickening thud in the red sands of a vast desert. She scurried back to her feet in an instant and looked around to get her bearings. The honey colored sea was now hanging above her as if the sky. She watched small schools of silver fish move together like one body, and larger fish trying catch the smaller ones. Then she saw a levitation, a whale, but one unlike any she had seen in the waking world. It was dark grey in color with sand colored spots, as big as the biggest Kitka ship. It hung in this sea like a cloud and she was momentarily in awe at its beauty. Again in the distance she heard Nagku’s howl, and by that knew which direction to head. She walked for an indiscernible amount of time, as time here was strange. Her mind went back to her experience with the atzutza smoke, this timelessness was not dissimilar. She walked at a fast steady pace, close to jogging but not quite, each step as silent as the last. Her skill as a scout was innate, done without thought, built into the muscles. The desert seemed to end abruptly and change into a familiar open plain, the sielya gwelta (the tall grasses) sprung to mind, she tried to abandon that dark thought, but then over a small hill there it was, a place kitka children were warned about. The tall grasses seemed to spread out endlessly before her. Standing at its edge she heard Nagku’s cry coming from inside. She brandished her dagger and entered. The grasses were taller than little Tegla who was smaller and shorter than most of her people. She moved slowly now, hoping to sneak up on whatever was happening and observe before acting. 

The grasses seemed to grab and pull at her cloak as she pushed her way forward, and she could feel in her spirit the presence of a great evil here. She got to an open circle in the middle of the tall grasses, but hesitated to step out into it. She instead hunkered down and looked to see what she could see. There stood Nagku in the center on this circle and beside him a women dressed all in white. The driftwood people were not a beautiful or handsome people even to their own standards, and they knew this. All depictions of the kitka made by the kitka in drawings or sculpture where idealized and false, what they wanted to look like, not at all how they actually appeared, but this women now standing in front of Tegla was truly beautiful. She was tall and slender with fair skin, long black hair, and rose red lips. Her eyes where a magnificent shade of blue like an open cloudless sky on a perfect summer day. 

She spoke softly to Nagku, her voice like a birds song was also beautiful, “you’re neither man nor beast, you’re a monster. You exist in the liminal space between all things, not this, but not that, not here, but not there. You wish to be alone, but feel so lonely. Unloved, unwanted, feared, but not respected. Rejected as a child, without family or friends. Why do you exist Nagku, you have no purpose, there is no meaning to your life. Everyone you have ever loved has abandon you.”

Nagku weeped, with his black hands covering his face. His form shifted and where once sat a man now sat a little boy. The boy wore a long hooded coat that was too big for him, he sobbed as well, and wipped his running nose on his sleeve.

“Ah Nak-Nak, good.” The chicken killer said with a smile. “The ghost of Nagku’s childhood, the ghost of the dimma skog, the forever child, alone, so alone. Where is your mother Nak-Nak? Where is your father? They abandon you didn’t they? Why, because you were not a good boy, because you were strange, abnormal, rejected even by the other children, alone, so alone. You’re better off a ghost you know, it suits you, you where born a ghost, dead in the womb. So fearful, afraid of everything with no one to comfort you. Remember waking up the the middle of the night from a bad dream, soaked in sweat, smelling of urine, calling out for a mother that wasn’t there, wishing for the strength of father you never knew. Who will teach you to be a man? No one! Who will teach you to be brave, to be strong, no one! 

Tegla could stand to listen no longer, enraged at the abuse she witnessed she sprang forward. 

“Tegla the runt!” Said the chicken killer. “So nice of you to join us. What do you plan to do with that little dagger, slay me? I’m already dead. Can you’re small mind even comprehend my power, all of the souls I have trapped in the sielya gwelta, I feed off there misery, it fuels me as it delights me, and this idiot beast will too be mine, and in one blow, I will doom the whole island to oblivion. Your stupidity, your arrogance has brought you here alone.

“Do you ever shut up?” Quipped Tegla. “you must love to hear you’re own wicked words. I know of you, chicken killer. You prey on the broken, but I am not broken. Your lies, your tricks won’t move me, and I am not afraid!”

“I don’t have to trick you, you insolent child, I only need keep him here. Right now outside of this dream the island is being destroyed, and your people are hiding, huddled together underground like worms.”

Tegla’s anger overwhelmed her and she charge the monster. She struck out with the dagger aiming for the chicken killers heart, but her dagger passed through her as if Tegla was fighting the fog. The monster laughed. 

“you can’t hurt me” she said with a cackle that sent chills up Tegla’s spine. 

Nagku’s form shifted again, and he appeared as a young man. The chicken killer, having properly humiliated the young scout turned her malice back to the unlearning beast.

“This is who they sent to save you? A scout that cares more about her reputation than she does your life? Where are the warriors? Where is King Migka Narudt? Did you not once consider him a friend? The tribe only placates you because they feel sorry for you, they still consider you annathari (stranger), an outsider, and a mad man. You’re nothing but a burden to these people.”

“That’s not true, Nagku! Don’t listen to these lies!” Shouted Tegla “King Migka was worried about you, we all were. We just didn’t know what to do! Migka sent me to figure out the problem, to check on you, because he cares about you. I was suppose to report back to him, that was his orders, but I’m a fool, I see that now. I thought I could do this alone, I didn’t want to ask for help, my stupid pride clouded my judgment, but I’m asking for your help now! Please wake up! Wake up and we will figure this out together!” Wake up, and I will come back with our greatest warriors and we will make this liar eat her words!”

Nagku raised his head, looked into Tegla’s eyes, and there he saw the truth. For a moment the chicken killers grasp on Nagku’s mind slipped, and in that moment he willed himself awake. 

## What is love and what is hate?

Once again in the waking world, Tegla and Nagku sat facing each other in the heart of the dark forest. Nagku’s fire had mostly gone out, but bright red embers still remained. They looked around at all the fallen trees, the forest had been badly damaged, worse than the night before. In the distance at Elta’s peak smoke rose, ash was blanketing the island, falling down like grey snow. Nagku looked more like a man than he had the night before, though his hands still black with claws curved like fisherman’s hooks, and his eyes still wild and golden, there was a kindness to his face, and a calmness now which Tegla hadn’t seen previously. 

Surprisingly to Tegla, Nagku spoke, “thank you, young kitka. This women in my nightmares, I think she means to drive me mad. I can’t fight her, I’m too tired, and too broken, I haven’t the heart or will left in me.” 

His voice was low and raspy, but there was a gentleness there. 

“You needn’t fight her alone, not anymore, I will not abandon you.”

With the help of the magic whistle Tegla made her way back to the tribe and directly to King Migka. She had been humbled by the chicken killer and telling Migka of her mistakes humbled her further, but her pride didn’t seem to matter much to her anymore, this flaw which was at one time invisible to her now seemed so strikingly evident and ridiculous to her. She had learned a valuable lesson, and was better for it. Where only a day ago she refused to seek help, now she adamantly demanded it. Migka reprehended her for her disobedience, but saw in her new growth, and new found maturity, so wasn’t as harsh as he might have been otherwise. Every word the chicken killer said was burned into Tegla’s mind and she replayed these words endlessly looking for some kink in her armor, some slip of the tongue that gave the game away, some advantage to use against her. 

“She said that the lost souls trapped in the tall grasses fuel her, that she feeds off their sorrow. Is it possible that we could release these souls and weaken her?” Said Tegla 

Migka responded, “anything is possible. Perhaps we simply burn the tall grasses to the ground!”

Every material thing to the driftwood people was thought to have a spirit, it was a custom to thank your shoes for protecting your feet, your bowl for holding your food, you blanket for keeping you warm, but the spirit of a thing could be corrupted. say language is misused and an evil book is written, the spirit of the paper, which was once the spirit of a tree or plant would be tarnished, twisted against its will. To free this spirit two things could be done. The first thing would be that the book, or the material of the book, could be reused to create something good. The second thing is that the book could be burned freeing the spirit and sending it back into the cycle of destruction and creation to once more become something new. So in this way burning the sielya gwelta made perfect sense to both Migka and Tegla. The spirits trapped there, the grasses, the land itself had been corrupted, and king Migka would see all emancipated on this very day. Prince Snalla approached. 

“Listen my son, I need you to rally 80 archers. Have them collect arrows that can be set aflame and March at once to the outskirts of the tall grasses and wait for me there” Migka instructed 

“Yes father, I will dispatch them immediately” responded Snalla

“Tegla, I think I have a plan. I need you to go back into the dimma skog and retrieve four yumyum monkeys, one for each of the four sacred directions. These small monkeys sleep in the canopy of the forest, you will know them by their vibrant colors, each striped from head to toe, and each strip a different color, and no monkey with the same stripes.”

“Yes! Of course! I understand. Very clever my king!” Tegla said with a smile

The yumyum monkey slept for 8 years at a time only waking for a three days to eat and mate between these eight year periods, it lived in the dream world, was connected to it, and had a power there. If you slept with one of these monkeys in your hand the monkey would become a dagger in the dream able to slay nightmare monsters or at the very least banish them from the dream. It was common for young kitka to keep these monkeys as pets, and sleep with them in hand at night. Tegla used the whistle and left right away. king Migka gathered and put on his best leather armor and finest grey cloak and headed for the sielya gwelta. There he met Snalla and his small army. Snalla was dressed for war in his green and brown snail armor.

“Snalla, have one group take torches and light the outer part of the tall grasses, have the rest shoot flaming arrows into its heart, and instruct them that no one is to go into the grasses. Now let’s see what happens” commanded Migka

“At once, father.” Said Snalla

The tall grasses barring an abundance of old, dead, and dry grass sparked easily, and before long a giant fire raged. Migka had assumed that animals, rabbits and such, would retreat from the fire, but he was wrong. Nothing living seemed to call this cursed place home. The fire blazed for hours until nothing was left but smoldering ash, and then the ghosts appeared, hundreds of them, some kitka, and others what Migka thought might be the gula tuatha, a lost people that lived on the island before the kitka. They had built strange houses and other eldritch architecture some of which still stood on the island. the Kitka regarded these places as bad luck, and rarely went around them, much less inside, still there was the curious few. The kitka had also found various books left by these people, none of which they could read, but they enjoyed contemplating the meanings of the elaborate illustrations. The ghosts seemed confused and wandered around the hot ashes, until the Pale Blue Traveler suddenly appeared and spoke.

“It’s time to go to the next world, my children” said the Traveler to the ghosts

His voice was like music, beautiful, resplendent, and calming. This was not the voice of a man, but of the creator of all things. He was love, compassion, and mercy. He was all the wonderful mysteries of the universe. He was the breath of life itself. He was composed of a bright shining pale blue light, but to describe him any more than this would be impossible. He waved his hand and a door appeared and opened. The ghosts began to go through this opening to places unknown until all were gone and the door and the Pale Blue Traveler vanished. For a long time everyone was silent and still, dumbstruck and in awe of what they had witnessed.

## Second chances

Tegla was now in the tree tops of the dimma skog collecting the last of the four sleeping yumyum monkeys. She carefully placed them in a medium sized sack, they didn’t stir or wake. Night was approaching so she used the whistle to swiftly rush back to the beach. When she arrived Snalla and Migka were waiting, along with Bruga Who not having heard back from Tegla had came from the swampland to the beach village to check on her. 

“I have the yumyum monkeys!” Tegla announced 

“Good” replied Migka, “everyone huddle up we need to quickly talk about our plan. She will expect you to come back Tegla, but she may not expect us. This gives us an advantage, the element of surprise. War is not unlike a game and the kitka cheat! We are going to ambush her. Hopefully she is weakened by us setting the trapped spirits of the tall grasses free, but this isn’t a given. Also the yumyum weapons work on nightmare monsters, but I am still unsure if they will work on her, we can only hope. This may be our last chance.”

“We can all move at once if we are touching Tegla when she blows the whistle,” instructed Snalla

“Okay, everyone put a hand on Tegla’s shoulders, we are as ready as we will ever be.”

Tegla blew the whistle, thought Nagku, and in an abrupt manner all four found themselves at Nagku’s side. Night had came and the unlearning beast was asleep in his hole. Tegla then handed each party member one of the yumyum monkeys.

“Quickly now, we must all hold hands as Tegla and I sing the dream song, close your eyes, listen, and envision Nagku.” Said Bruga

When they opened their eyes they found themselves in Nagku’s nightmare. The honey colored sea and the desert were gone. Now the tall grasses spread endlessly in every direction like a sickness taking over Nagku’s mind. The four moved silently through the grasses communicating only with body language like a wolf pack, and because of Migka’s clever thinking each brandished a sliver dream daggers that in the waking world were the yumyum monkeys.

Snalla side by side with tegla now whispered into her ear, “remember what I said about the game the other night? We are going to need you to make a distraction while we circle around her and attack from behind.”

Tegla nodded in agreement, and they kept moving. Getting closer to the center of the tall grasses they could hear Nagku’s screams. In do course they found themselves outside the circle of flattened grass where the chicken killer tortured poor Nagku. As Snalla had said the three circled around and waited as tegla entered the circle facing the chicken killer. There was notable change in her appearance. Once young and beautiful she now appeared hag like, hunch backed, and hideous. She locked eyes with Tegla.

“The runt is back” the chicken killer hissed at Tegla. “I bet you feel very clever having burned down my trap and setting my prisoners free, but the misery of this world is never-ending, and it sustains me. The tall grasses will grow back, and more people will be caught in my web. I am inevitable. you will die by my hands this night.”

In a trice the chicken killer lounged at Tegla, and lifted her by her throat with one hand. Seeing this the other three sprang from there cover and attacked. They stabbed her repeatedly, but the daggers had no effect, and the chicken killer swatted them away with her free hand like tiny insects. 

“I will rip off your head, girl” said the chicken killer.

“Nagku! Help me!” Tegla pleaded. “You are our guardian, it is your purpose. You are stronger than her! This island belongs to you. she is just an interloper in your domain. Whatever she has told you is a lie!”

The chicken killer squeeze harder making Tegla unable to speak. Nagku looked up into Tegla’s face. A lot of people had treated him badly during his life, but the kitka had always been kind. A rage quickly grew inside of him.

“Let her go!” He commanded.

The chicken killer ignored him, thinking him to weak and demoralized to do anything, but as his anger took hold his form shifted. He became larger, and more fearsome, towering over the the tall grasses and the chicken killer. Then with one swift movement of his massive clawed hand he grabbed his torturer. As he lifted her into the air she dropped Tegla and screamed. He then raised her up to his beastly maw and promptly bit her head off, threw the body out into the tall grasses, and  spit the demons skull out onto the ground before him. Tegla ran to him and embraced him crying. 

“It’s time to go home now Nagku, it’s time to wake up” 

## A friendship made

Once back in the waking world Nagku stayed with the tribe for a short time. They made merry, had celebrations in his honor, and even performed a ceremony making him a member of the driftwood tribe. The nightmare was finally over. Eventually Nagku needing his solitude went back to his camp fire in the dark forest, but Tegla visited him everyday.
