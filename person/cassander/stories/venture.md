## Breaking dinner plates

In the great house where all things reside Tsula the blueberry king stands atop blueberry hill. 

“Is this it? Is this all there is? What hell! What terror!” Says Tsula as onlookers gathered at the bottom of the hill. “We are trapped in the dining hall! For each there is a plate set before them, and for each there is a plate with which to sit upon, for God has a plan to kill us all! My warriors, my wise ones, my tricksters, thieves, heroes and villains we must escape the dinning hall, we must escape the plate!” 

The Driftwood people debated amongst themselves as to what their plight was and if there was anything to do about it for a long time until King Migka Narudt (king over all the island) spoke up, “We will build long canoes and leave this world, we will find the edges of the great house and even those we will cross.” And so they began. They built three long canoes and thought themselves very clever.

“How will we leave the earth in canoes which cannot fly” asked Tsula. 

“We must wait until the next full moon and ask Yolla to come down from the moon and bless them," replied Migka.

They waited for three nights and on the third night the moon was full and they asked Yolla to join them. Three days later she descended down to the island riding on the back of the night. Her eyes where dark and sad, her hair silver, and her face pale. She wore a thick long hooded coat. On each of the canoes she wrote the name of the night, and eight days later a single baby was found in the bottom of each canoe. The babies where named Mim, Myr, and Magi, they were the first of the canoe spirits. In three days further they had grown into adults. The three could paddle the canoes on land, air, and water, at great speed without becoming tired. They took great delight in taking the driftwood people high into the air and suddenly dropping only lifting off again seconds before hitting the ground and although the driftwood people would scream they liked it as well.

“We now have the means to travel, but how will we know where to go?” Ask Tsula.

“We must find Sigla the navigator to guide us. Send out a scout to find her.” Replied Migka 

Tegla de Nammi Nishgwi was sent out to find Sigla. Tegla was the smallest of the driftwood people, but also the bravest. In preparation for her mission she put on her finest white shoes, a sand colored cloak, and painted her face white with ash which was the custom for young scouts. Tegla loved to roam and explore and greatly admired the navigator who did so ceaselessly.  Her tiny heart raced at the thought of meeting Sigla and possibly learning from her, and hearing her many stories. Sigla was at sea not far from the island fishing from her small house boat when she first heard Tegla’s call. 

“What do you need little one” asked Sigla
“King Migka requests your service as a guide” Tegla answered 
“I can guide him anywhere he wants to go besides home, that is my curse.” Said Sigla
“Please tell me of your adventures, What have you seen out there great navigator?” Asked Tegla 
“Everything but home.” Replied Sigla “for thousands of years I searched here and there and in   the spaces in-between for something, but I found only loss. Now i just fish and eat and sleep and play little games by myself. There is magic out there, but it’s not what you think it is.”

When Tegla rejoined the driftwood people she felt the weight of her steps were heavier than before. 

That night the driftwood people celebrated. A banquet was prepared, they danced and sung and ate and drank until a warm glow covered everything. Some speculated that before they left the world they should destroy it, that this would end all suffering and be the moral thing to do. Some thought about the things they might miss.

“I will miss the water and the fish.” Said Nishdoa

“I will miss nothing.” said Migka “well, maybe games, I always enjoyed a good game.”

“Will there be music where we are going?” Asked Snalla

“I suppose there is music everywhere, maybe songs we cant even imagine.” 

Agalisga and Tagi butted in, “can father come with us, we wont leave without him.”

“Yes children, everyone can go with the exception of Nagku who as you know cannot leave the forest.” Answered Migka

“What about our toys!?” 

“You can each bring one.”

Agalisga and Tagi ran off giggling. 

“I will miss the hunt and the fireflies.” Said Heyaka

Tsula asked, “what if we die on the journey?”

They all thought about this for a while and then agreed that seeing as they were always bound to die that it didn't really matter, and that they were better off not thinking about it.

The next morning the tribes buzzed with excitement, eager to see something new, to face danger, to be the brave explorers they knew themselves to be, and they called this day leaving day. They first marched into the dark forest with offerings of food and blankets to leave for Nagku, which only annoyed the beast.  They then boarded the three canoes most carrying what little they owned. Some carried the tools of their various trades, others carried instruments, some packed food, and others took nothing. Mim, Myr, and Magi paddled them out to Sigla’s little house boat. Sigla greeted them happily as she always enjoyed company,

“Hello, my lovelies!” said Sigla

She hopped from her house boat into Myr’s canoe which Migka also road. She carried a compass, a lantern, and a large freshly caught Flounder. 

“I have thought over our journey, and where we need to go,” said Sigla.

“And what is your recommendation?” asked Migka

“The driftwood people are clever but not wise, so I propose we speak to someone who is wise, ung.” 

“Lead us to Ung then great navigator.”

Sigla looked out to sea. Then in her biggest voice, “GULLA KA BRUGK! GULLA KA BRUGK! GULLA KA BRUGK! As she said this the third time she threw the flounder high into the air, and before it hit the water an enormous golden serpent leaped from the sea and caught the flounder in its massive jaws. The golden serpent was longer than the three canoes combined. It’s scales glistened in the sun, as it moved effortlessly through the water. It raised its head to Myr’s canoe where Sigla stood and Sigla’s reflection could be seen in its massive golden eye. Some of the driftwood people trembled at the sight and made themselves small in their seats, others awed at the beauty of the creature and stood up to get a better look. 

“Ka my old friend will you please open the way?” Said Sigla

The great beast brought its face forward, and Sigla put her hand on the top of its head. It then swam some paces from the canoes. Its back started to arch out of the water creating what looked like a golden rainbow. Its head and tail disappeared under the surface of the sea and the golden ached back started to shift and transform, what began as a snake now looked more like a bridge, with each scale becoming a golden brick. 

“Listen, as we pass under the bridge you must imagine yourself a puff of smoke restlessly pacing the floor in a futile attempt to occupy space, imagine yourself the vibration of a single plucked thread of a spiders web, imagine yourself the glisten in the magpies eye when it spy’s a shiny treasure, imagine yourself a keyhole and hold your breath. Myr, Mim, and magi, forwards and through!” 

## Where the scarlet birds follow

None of the Diftwood people had ever seen Ung, but their belief in his existence was as strong and as innate as their belief in their own. They passed under the bridge into a city of rubble like none had ever seen. Trees and vines grew in and around once massive stone buildings. The leafy canopy blocked out all but scattered rays of the sunlight, and tall grasses grew threw and from once wide roads and sidewalks. Devoid of people the silence was palatable. The canoes flew noiselessly a foot above the ground, and none of the driftwood people spoke. They where in a new land unlike their home on the little island Athlandrun, and all looked silent and amazed. Perfectly in the moment, the driftwood people once again felt alive, the new experience made them new as well. Their hearts and minds had changed in seconds and their old selves were left back on the island.  Sigla jumped down from the canoe and started leading the party on foot with her lantern held out in front of her.

“Where are we?” asked Migka

“We are where Ung is.” Replied Sigla “the City of Rubble”

Suddenly the songs of birds could be heard, small scarlet birds arrived and started to move along with them. The birds watched as they moved through the city that nature took back.

“Beautiful.” Said little Tegla as one landed on the edge of the canoe.

“I think they are scarlet Tanagers.” Said Tsula who knew quite a lot of facts.

“Can I play with them?” Asked Agalisa

“Leave them alone” Migka said and laughed.

As they ventured further into the city more scarlet tanagers arrived until the trees and bushes around the three canoes were full of them and their songs filled the air.

“Did you feel that?” Sigla said suddenly, “the ground shook.” 

“I thought I heard a low rumble,” said Migka

“There it was again,” said Sigla

“I definitely heard it that time,” said Migka

The pulsing rhythmic noise they heard seemed to be getting closer like thunder in an oncoming storm, and the closer the noise came the more the ground shook. Tsula and Migka jumped down from the canoes and joined Sigla.

“Ready your weapons. Snalla, Heyaka, down by me,” commanded Migka

As Prince Snalla and Heyaka joined Migka, Snalla blew a wooden whistle he wore around his neck, and all the warriors readied their weapons and stood at attention. The ground shook again as the low roar boomed. Heyaka growled and bared his teeth with dagger in hand. Snalla drew back an arrow. Suddenly the Scarlet Tanagers grew still and quiet.

“HELP!” Screamed Tsula. 

In an instant a long sticky tongue had shot out from under the ground and wrapped itself around Tsula’s leg.

Again Tsula screamed, “It’s pulling me it in! It wont let go!”
“What is it!?” Shouted Snalla

Heyaka always brave ran forward and slashed at the huge tongue with his dagger.

“It won’t cut!” Cried heyaka    
 “Grab him!” Exclaimed Migka as he ran forward grabbing Tsula’s hand.

Heyaka dropped his dagger and grabbed Tsula’s other hand and Snalla grabbed him by the waist and Sigla seized Snalla creating a small chain

“Pull!” Said Migka
“What Terror! What hell! Cried Tsula as his leg was pulled deeper into the earth.

Snalla took his whistle with his teeth and blew again and the warriors let out a barrage of arrows into the ground which had seemingly no effect.  Abruptly the loud low boom rang out again, the ground shook violently causing all to loose their hold on Tsula and in seconds he disappeared underground. 

“You bastard! Come out and fight me!” Screamed Migka

The ground quaked and multiple tongues sprung from underneath taking hold of the canoes and the driftwood people and dragging them down into the earth until none but Migka was left.

“Come out and face me, demon!” Yelled Migka in an angry fit.

And with this the attacker surfaced. It was a small purple frog with large golden eyes. It croaked and the ground shuddered. Its tongue seemingly to long and large for its body shot out and grabbed Migka’s ankle and pulled him to the ground where he begin sliding towards the frogs wide open mouth. 

“No, you wont take me!” Said Migka as he looked around for something to grab onto and saw Heyaka’s dropped dagger.

He quickly grabbed the dagger and plunged into the earth.

“No, no, no, not like this!” He moaned

The Scarlet Tanagers started to sing again and flew into the air. As Migka watched they moved as one body and formed a red whirlwind. Quicker and quicker they flew around until the fallen leaves and small rocks on the ground lifted into the air.  The small scarlet birds began to dissolve into one another until there stood Ung. Beautiful, but frightening Ung was the unknown, he was language, we was the wild unseen places. He wore all yellow and his face was a mirror which Migka now saw himself struggle in.

“Don’t be afraid child, just let go” said Ung
“No!” Migka shouted “I’m not ready to die!”
“It’s okay child, just let go.” Ung said softly.
A calm washed over Migka and he thought,  “it will only be a moment.” He then let go of the dagger and was swallowed by the purple frog. 

## Broken

Migka found himself in the dark. The pain in his leg was the greatest he had ever felt. He reached down to feel and the leg had been broken and the bone was jutting out. His pelvis also felt broken, and if was hard to breath. He smelled wet earth and could hear the muffled cry’s of his people all around him. 

“I am here!” He called “I’m hurt. Is everyone okay!?

He heard someone reply, but couldn’t make it out. He then heard movement above him and soon the moonlight broke through the wooden casket and he was pulled out of a shallow grave by Nagku the forgetting beast. Nagku stood over him and even in this moment he felt a mix of fear and respect. Nagku said nothing, and instead began to walk away deeper into the dark forest. The driftwood people were strewn about on the ground most injured and all covered in mud from being buried. He recognized the cemetery. He was back on the island. He took count of the survivors and all were there but Tsula. A light rain came down which only made the mud worse. 

“I need help, I cant stand,” said Migka

Nishdoa set the bone as best as he could and bandaged Migka’s leg, none of the Driftwood tribe where surgeons or doctors at all. Migka was handed a tall stick to lean on and Nishdoa went about helping others of their broken lot. 

“Where is Tsula, has anyone seen him? Are the children okay?” Asked Migka 

“Tegla, Tagi, and Agalisga are fine, just scared, but unharmed. Tsula is missing though,” answered Snalla. 

“Does this mean war? We must go back and kill our attacker.” Said Heyaka.

“We were not attacked, we were sent home,” answered Migka

Mim, Myr, and Magi called for the canoes and they also arose from the Earth.”

“Let’s go home,” said Migka.

By daybreak they where back in the kingdom at the doors of Athlandrun.

What hell! What Terror! There paced Tsula the blueberry king on blueberry hill wet and covered in mud.

“What did I tell you! Did I not say it?! For each there is a plate set before them and for each there is a plate for which to sit upon for God has a plan to kill us all!” Huffed Tsula

Migka tired and wounded looked up, “Please be quiet, Tsula.”

The end.
